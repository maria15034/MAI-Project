# MAI-Project
This is the repository for my MAI Project at TCD on battery health. 

Here you will find the code I used to pre-process some of the raw data, and also the code for modelling it using LSTM and SVR. 

If you would like to run the modelling code yourself, you can find the prepared data as 'experimental_data_all.csv' and 'synthetic_data_all.csv'. Alternatively if you want to start from the raw data and run the pre-processing code, you can find this at ... . 
If you want to have a look at the model used to generate the data, see https://github.com/DEARLIBS by Dr. Seongbeom Lee. Alternatively, I have uploaded my adaptation of the code here, which has some changes for the purpose of the project.

More details about the data generation process, data pre-processing and data modelling are all included in my thesis.
