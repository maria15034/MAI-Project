# MAI-Project
This is the repository for my final year project at TCD on battery health estimation. 

Here you will find the following,
1. The data generation code which is based on the P2D model implementation by Dr. Seongbeom Lee from https://github.com/DEARLIBS.
2. The code I used to pre-process the generated raw data.
3. The code for modelling it using both LSTM and SVR. 

More details about the data generation process, data pre-processing and data modelling are all included in my thesis. 
For each section, I will include instructions on how to run it and what files are required. Matlab is required for part 1. Parts 2 and 3 are Jupyter Notebooks, so you could use Google Colab for example to run them.

Additionally, some code for analysing the metadata (i.e the values for the 8 parameters decided via PSO) are included in the 'Misc.' folder.
