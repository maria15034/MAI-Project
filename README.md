# MAI-Project
This is the repository for my final year project at TCD on battery health estimation. 

Here you will find the following,
1. The data generation uses the code by Dr. Seongbeom Lee from https://github.com/DEARLIBS, which I have adapted for the purpose of my project.
1. The code I used to pre-process the generated raw data.
3. The code for modelling it using both LSTM and SVR. 

For each section, I will include instructions on how to run it and what files are required. More details about the data generation process, data pre-processing and data modelling are all included in my thesis.
