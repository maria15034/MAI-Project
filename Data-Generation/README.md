A number of Matlab toolboxes are required to run the P2D.m code. These include Symbolic Math, Optimization, Global Optimization, and Parallel Computing. You may require more based on your Matlab environment.

Additionally, when running the P2D.m script, a vector of voltage data as a .txt file is provided as input. This is the data PSO uses to find the 8 unknown parameters. Refer to sorted_labelled_data.xlsx for the number of time and data points.
